## ðŸšœ Firebase Remote Config setup guide

To use the `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`, you don't need to add `firebase_remote_config` to your project's `pubspec.yaml` as it's already included as a dependency of `versionarte` package.

However, you need to add a new parameter to your Firebase Remote Config porject to contain the relevant information for your app. Here are the steps to follow:

### Step 1: Open Remote Config dashboard
Go to <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a> website and select your project. Then, click on the `Remote Config` button.

If you haven't added any configuration parameters yet, click the `Create configuration` button.

If you already have some parameters, click the `Add parameter` button.

### Step 2: Upload "versionarte" parameter.

Fill the `Parameter name (key)` field with `versionarte` and choose `Data type` as `JSON`.

Then, expand the `Default value` field and fill it with the `JSON` which derived from <a href="https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/versionarte#%EF%B8%8F-configuration-json" target="_blank">versionarte configuration JSON</a> in a way that it represents the information for your app.

When you click on the `Save` button, the pop-up will be closed. Click on the `Save` button again to confirm the changes.

ðŸŽ‰ By following these steps, you should now have the versionarte parameter in your Firebase Remote Config, which you can use to manage your app's versioning and availability.
