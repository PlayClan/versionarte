# versionarte

Versionarte allows you to remotely manage your Flutter app's versioning and availability, with a variety of heplful, and in some cases life-saving features with total freedom over the UI allowing you to customize the user experience to fit your app's branding and style.

Features you can implement with versionarte:
- üòà Force users to update to the latest version of your app before continuing.
- üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have different minimum, latest versions and availability status for each platform.
- üöß Disable your app for maintenance with custom information text.
- üÜï Inform users when a new, optional update is available..
- üîó Launch the App Store on iOS and Play Store on Android.

## üöÄ Motivation

Mobile application development is unique in that any changes, whether it be adding new features, fixing bugs, or disabling the app for maintenance, requires submitting a new version to the stores and waiting for approval. Even after approval, users may still need to manually update their app to have the latest version.

To simplify the app versioning process, versionarte offers remote management of app versioning and availability. This makes the app development process more controllable.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

Before you use, bear in mind that this package uses a specific, not editable JSON format to convey the app's version and availability status to the package. [See the JSON format](#json-format)

Versionarte package helps check the version of the app on a device against the version available on the store. The package uses `package_info_plus` to get the package information and `pub_semver` to parse and compare version numbers.

### Getting `VersionarteResult` object

To get the `VersionarteResult` object, you need to call the `Versionarte.check` method. This method takes a `VersionarteProvider` instance as a parameter, which is responsible for fetching the versioning information from the remote service. The `Versionarte.check` method returns a `VersionarteResult` object, which contains the result of the versioning check.

There are two built-in providers that you can use to fetch the versioning information from the remote service: `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider` and `RestfulVersionarteProvider`. You can also create your own custom provider by extending the `VersionarteProvider` class.

#### Using Firebase Remote Config
The `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider` class uses the Firebase Remote Config service to fetch the versioning information. You need to set up the Firebase Remote Config service before using this provider. You can find the official documentation for setting up Firebase Remote Config <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config">here</a>.

Below is a example of how to use Versionarte with Firebase Remote Config:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider(),
);
```

The `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider` has 1 optional parameter:
- `keyName`: used to specify the key name for the Firebase Remote Config to fetch. By default, it's set to "versionarte". If you want to upload the [configuration JSON](#json-format) using different key name, you can use this parameter to specify the key name.

#### Using RESTful API

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RestfulVersionarteProvider(
        url: 'https://myapi.com/getVersioning',
    ),
);
```

#### Using custom VersionarteProvider

If you want to use a custom provider, say you use some other remote service to provide versioning details of your app, you can extend the `VersionarteProvider` class and override the `getStoreVersioning` method. This method is responsible for fetching the versioning information from the remote service and returning it as a `StoreVersioning` object.

```dart
class MyCustomVersionarteProvider extends VersionarteProvider {
  @override
  Future<StoreVersioning> getStoreVersioning() async {
    final result = MyCustomService.fetchVersioning();

    final decodedResult = jsonDecode(result);

    return StoreVersioning.fromJson(decodedResult);
  }
```
    
Then, you can use your custom provider in the `Versionarte.check` method:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: MyCustomVersionarteProvider(),
);
```

### Handling the result

Then, based on the versioning state, you can decide what to do next. Here's an example of how to handle the different cases:

```dart
if (result == VersionarteResult.inactive) {
    final message = result.status.getMessageForLanguage('en');
    // TODO: Handle the case where the app is inactive
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.mustUpdate) {
    // TODO: Handle the case where an update is required
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.shouldUpdate) {
    // TODO: Handle the case where an update is optional
} 
```

There are two other values that you can receive as a result: `VersionarteStatus.upToDate` and `VersionarteStatus.unknown`. But these two are never used mostly.

Note that you don't need to try-catch the Versionarte.check function, as the called function catches all the errors inside. If anything goes wrong, an instance of VersionarteResult is still returned, with a message property containing the error message. Also, be sure to check the debug console to see the debug-only prints that the package prints.

Maybe you want to use Firestore, Graphql or any other service to provider `StoreVersioning`? Extend `VersionarteProvider`, override `getStoreVersioning`, fetch serverside data, parse it into a `StoreVersioning` instance using `StoreVersioning.fromJson` factory constructor:

### Redirecting to the store

The `Versionarte.launchStore` method is a utility method provided by the Versionarte package that opens the app's store page in the device's app store app.

See the <a href="https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/versionarte/tree/main/example">example</a> directory for a complete sample app.

## üñãÔ∏è JSON format

versionarte has a specific JSON format, which you must use to provide the versioning details remotely. Whether you're using `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`, `RestfulVersionarteProvider`, or a custom `VersionarteProvider`, you must always use the structured JSON below:

```js
{
    "android": {
        "version": {
            "minimum": "2.7.0",
            "latest": "2.8.0"
        },
        "status": {
            "active": true,
            "message": {
                "en": "App is in maintanence mode, please come back later.",
                "es": "La aplicaci√≥n est√° en modo de mantenimiento, vuelva m√°s tarde."
            }
        }
    },
    "iOS": {
        // same data we used for "android"
    }
    "macOS": {
        // same data we used for "android"
    }
}
```

This JSON object represents the versioning information for an app, including its minimum and latest versions, and the maintenance status of the app. The information is stored separately for three different platforms: Android, iOS, and macOS.

Each platform contains two objects:

- `version`: An object that contains information about the minimum and latest version of the app. 
    - `minimum`: The minimum version of the app that users can use. 
    - `latest`: The latest version of the app that is available.
- `status`: An object that contains information about the availability of the app.
    - `active`: A boolean that indicates whether the app is currently in active or not.
    - `message`: A map that contains the maintenance messages for different languages. The keys of the map represent the language codes (e.g., "en" for English, "es" for Spanish), and the values represent the corresponding maintenance message in that language. If the app is not in maintenance mode, this field may be null or empty.
