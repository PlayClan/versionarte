# versionarte

A package for Flutter that allows you to remotely manage your app's versioning and availability. Using versionarte, you can easily disable your app for usage with custom remotely stored information texts, show a forced update screen, show an update available screen, and provide a changelog to the user about latest changes on the app.

## üöÄ Motivation

Mobile application development is unique in that any changes, whether it be adding new features, fixing bugs, or disabling the app for maintenance, requires submitting a new version to the app store and waiting for approval. Even after approval, users may still need to manually update their app to access the latest version. 

To simplify the app versioning process, versionarte offers remote management of app versioning and availability. This makes the app development process more efficient and seamless, benefiting both developers and users alike.

## üñãÔ∏èJSON format

versionarte has a specific JSON format, which you must use to provide the versioning details remotely. Whether you're using `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`, `RestfulVersionarteProvider`, or a custom `VersionarteProvider`, you must always use the structured JSON below:

```js
{
    "android": {
        "minimum": {
            "number": 12,
            "name": "2.7.4"
        },
        "latest": {
            "number": 14,
            "name": "2.8.0"
        },
        "availability": {
            "available": true,
            "message": "Versionarte is unavailable.",
            "details": "App is in maintanence mode, please come back later."
        },
        "changelog": {
            "en": [
                "Minor improvements.",
                "Fixed login issue."
            ],
            "es": [
                "Peque√±as mejoras.",
                "Solucionado el problema de inicio de sesi√≥n."
            ]
        }
    },
    "ios": {
        // same data we used for "android"
    }
}
```

## üëÄ Before usage: terminology

### `StoreVersioning`
A model that represents the JSON structure mentioned above. It contains versioning details of the app, such as the latest version number, minimum version number, changelog, and so on.

### `VersionarteProvider`
A delegate that fetches an instance of `StoreVersioning`. You can implement it to create other sources of `VersionarteProvider`s such as Firestore, GraphQL, and so on.

### `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`
A VersionarteProvider that fetches `StoreVersioning` based on the Firebase Remote Config.

### `RestfulVersionarteProvider`
A VersionarteProvider that fetches `StoreVersioning` information by sending an HTTP GET request to the given URL.

### `LocalVersioning`
A model that contains versioning details of the currently running app. It has three fields: `androidVersion` for the current version number of the running Android app, `iosVersion` for the current version number of the running iOS app, and `platformVersion` for the version number of the current platform. The platformVersion property is a getter that returns the version number depending on the target platform of the app.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### A basic example
Below is a minimal example of how to use Versionarte with Firebase Remote Config to retrieve a VersionarteResult:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider(),
    localVersioning: await LocalVersioning.fromPackageInfo(),
);
```

In this example, we import the required packages and call the Versionarte.check function to retrieve the VersionarteResult. The RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider is used to retrieve the remote version information from Firebase Remote Config, and the LocalVersioning.fromPackageInfo() function is used to retrieve the local version information.

Then, we use the result to decide what to do next based on the versioning state. Here's an example of how to do that:

```dart
if (result == VersionarteResult.unavailable) {
  // TODO: Handle the case where remote version information is unavailable
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.mustUpdate) {
  // TODO: Handle the case where an update is required
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.couldUpdate) {
  // TODO: Handle the case where an update is optional
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.upToDate) {
  // TODO: If needed handle the case where the app is up to date
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.failedToCheck) {
  // TODO: If needed handle the case where the version check failed
}
```

Note that you don't need to try-catch the Versionarte.check function, as the called function catches all the errors inside. If anything goes wrong, an instance of VersionarteResult is still returned, with a message property containing the error message. Also, be sure to check the debug console to see the debug-only prints that the package prints.

You want to use your own RESTful API instead of FirebaseRemoteConfig? Use `RestfulVersionarteProvider`:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RestfulVersionarteProvider(
        url: 'https://myapi.com/getVersioning',
    ),
    localVersioning: await LocalVersioning.fromPackageInfo(),
);
```

Maybe you want to use Firestore, Graphql or any other service to provider `StoreVersioning`? Extend `VersionarteProvider`, override `getStoreVersioning`, fetch serverside data, parse it into a `StoreVersioning` instance using `StoreVersioning.fromJson` factory constructor:
