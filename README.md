# versionarte

Versionarte allows you to remotely manage your Flutter app's versioning and availability, with a variety of heplful, and in some cases life-saving features with total freedom over the UI allowing you to customize the user experience to fit your app's branding and style.

Features you can implement with versionarte:
- üòà Force users to update to the latest version of your app before continuing.
- üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Have different minimum, latest versions and availability status for separate platforms.
- üöß Disable your app for maintenance with custom information text.
- üÜï Inform users when a new, optional update is available..
- üîó Launch the App Store on iOS and Play Store on Android.

<!-- ## üöÄ Motivation

Mobile application development is unique in that any changes, whether it be adding new features, fixing bugs, or disabling the app for maintenance, requires submitting a new version to the stores and waiting for approval. Even after approval, users may still need to manually update their app to have the latest version.

To simplify the app versioning process, versionarte offers remote management of app versioning and availability. This makes the app development process more controllable. -->

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

Before using this package, it is important to note that it uses a specific JSON format to convey the app's version and availability status to the package. Please refer to the JSON format section for more information.

### Getting status

There are multiple ways to obtain the app's version and availability status using this package.

Note that you don't need to try-catch the Versionarte.check function, as the called function catches all the errors inside. If anything goes wrong, an instance of VersionarteResult is still returned, with a message property containing the error message. Also, be sure to check the debug console to see the debug-only prints that the package prints.

#### 1. Using Firebase Remote Config

The `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider` fetches versioning information stored in Firebase Remote Config with the key name of "versionarte". You need to set up the Firebase Remote Config service before using this provider. See [Firebase Remote Config setup guide](#üöú-firebase-remote-config-setup-guide) to learn more about configuration.

Below is a example of how to use versionarte with Firebase Remote Config:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider(),
);
```

The `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider` has 1 optional parameter:
- `keyName`: used to specify the key name for the Firebase Remote Config to fetch. By default, it's set to "versionarte". If you want to upload the [configuration JSON](#-json-format) using different key name, you can use this parameter to specify the key name.

#### 2. Using RESTful API

Below is a example of how to use versionarte with RESTful API:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: RestfulVersionarteProvider(
        url: 'https://myapi.com/getVersioning',
    ),
);
```

The `RestfulVersionarteProvider` has 1 optional parameter:
- `headers`: used to specify the headers for the request. By default, it's set to an empty map.

#### 3. Using custom VersionarteProvider

If you want to use a custom provider, say you use some other remote service to provide versioning and availability details of your app, you can extend the VersionarteProvider class and override the getStoreVersioning method. This method is responsible for fetching the versioning information from the remote service and returning it as a StoreVersioning object.

```dart
class MyCustomVersionarteProvider extends VersionarteProvider {
  @override
  Future<StoreVersioning> getStoreVersioning() async {
    final result = MyCustomService.fetchVersioning();

    final decodedResult = jsonDecode(result);

    return StoreVersioning.fromJson(decodedResult);
  }
```
    
Below is a example of how to use versionarte with `MyCustomVersionarteProvider` we created before:

```dart
final result = await Versionarte.check(
    versionarteProvider: MyCustomVersionarteProvider(),
);
```

### Handling the status

After fetching the versioning information using the Versionarte.check() method, the method returns a VersionarteResult object, which contains 3 parameters:

The method returns a `VersionarteResult` object, which contains 3 parameters:
- `status`: the versioning status of the app. It can be one of the following values:
    - `VersionarteStatus.appInactive`: the app is inactive and should not be used.
    - `VersionarteStatus.mustUpdate`: the app is active, but the user must update to the latest version.
    - `VersionarteStatus.shouldUpdate`: the app is active, but the user should update to the latest version.
    - `VersionarteStatus.upToDate`: the app is active and the user is using the latest version.
    - `VersionarteStatus.unknown`: the app is active, but the versioning status is unknown.
- `details`: The version details of the app for the current platform, including messages for when the app is inactive. 
- 'errorMessage`: The error message if any error occurred while fetching the versioning information.

Then, based on the versioning state, you can decide what to do next. Here's an example of how to handle the different cases:

```dart
if (result == VersionarteResult.appInactive) {
    final message = result.status.getMessageForLanguage('en');
    // TODO: Handle the case where the app is inactive
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.mustUpdate) {
    // TODO: Handle the case where an update is required
} else if (result == VersionarteResult.shouldUpdate) {
    // TODO: Handle the case where an update is optional
} 
```

### Redirecting to the stores

The `Versionarte.launchStore` method is a utility method provided by the Versionarte package that opens the app's store page in the device's app store app.

See the <a href="https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/versionarte/tree/main/example">example</a> directory for a complete sample app.

## üñãÔ∏è JSON format

versionarte has a specific JSON format, which you must use to provide the versioning and availability details remotely. Whether you're using `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`, `RestfulVersionarteProvider`, or a custom `VersionarteProvider`, you must always this structure.

Note:
- You don't need to provide the versioning information for all platforms. Say you only have an Android app, you can just provide the versioning information for Android and leave the iOS and macOS objects empty.
- When app status is active, you can leave the `message` object empty or `null`.

```js
{
    "android": {
        "version": {
            "minimum": "2.7.0",
            "latest": "2.8.0"
        },
        "status": {
            "active": true,
            "message": {
                "en": "App is in maintanence mode, please come back later.",
                "es": "La aplicaci√≥n est√° en modo de mantenimiento, vuelva m√°s tarde."
            }
        }
    },
    "iOS": {
        // same data we used for "android"
    }
    "macOS": {
        // same data we used for "android"
    }
}
```

This JSON object represents the versioning information for an app, including its minimum and latest versions, and the availability status of the app. The information is stored separately for three different platforms: Android, iOS, and macOS.

Each platform contains two objects:

- `version`: An object that contains information about the minimum and latest version of the app. 
    - `minimum`: The minimum version of the app that users can use. 
    - `latest`: The latest version of the app that is available.
- `status`: An object that contains information about the availability of the app.
    - `active`: A boolean that indicates whether the app is currently in active or not.
    - `message`: A map that contains the maintenance messages for different languages. The keys of the map represent the language codes (e.g., "en" for English, "es" for Spanish), and the values represent the corresponding maintenance message in that language. If the app is not in maintenance mode, this field may be null or empty.

## üöú Firebase Remote Config setup guide

To use `RemoteConfigVersionarteProvider`, you must first set up Firebase Remote Config in your app. You can follow the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/get-started?platform=flutter">official Flutter guide</a> to set up Firebase Remote Config in your app.

Assuming you've already set up Firebase Remote Config in your app, below are steps on how to set up versionarte with Firebase Remote Config:

### Step 1: open Remote Config tab
Navigate to the Remote Config tab of the Firebase Console. You should see a screen similar to the one below:

### Step 2: Upload "versionarte" parameter.

1. Create a new Firebase Remote Config parameter in the Firebase console. The parameter name must be `versionarte` and the default value must be the JSON object that contains the versioning information for your app. See the <a href="
